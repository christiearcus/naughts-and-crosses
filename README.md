### Rockets & Fighter Jets!

Welcome to my wonderful game of Rockets & Fighter Jets. Not to be mistaken with Naughts & Crosses. If you were raised by wolves, here is a simple guide to playing:

1. Grab a partner to play with :dancers:
2. Open http://christiearcus.github.io/naughts-and-crosses/
5. Play lots of times, or until one person becomes a smug winner :poop:

Enjoy!

### Technologies used

This browser based game is developed in Javascript, CSS and HTML.

The Javascript is custom built (i.e. no libraries were used), but the front end uses Bootstrap 3 for it's responsive grid and some glyphicons. The game tokens are from Font Awesome.

I also played around with flex-boxes for the game-grid, but in the end ran out of time for integration in to the project. Will be something I do as an enhancement.
