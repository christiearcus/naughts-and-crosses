### Naughts & Crosses

Welcome to my wonderful game of naughts & crosses. If you were raised by wolves, here is a simple guide to playing:

1. Grab a partner to play with :dancers:
2. Open [ ADD URL HERE ]
3. Pick a side (naughts or crosses)
4. Each taking a turn, the aim is to get yourself a line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal) before the other player
5. Repeat lots of times, or until one person becomes a smug winner :poop:

Enjoy!
